# Genetic Algorithm with TSP

This is an implementation of genetic algorithm to solve Travelling Salesman Problem to find the best path, given the number of epochs. The implementation is done with a complete graph with 20 nodes.

This implementation will only works if the graph is **COMPLETE**. If the graph is not complete, the code has to be modified accordingly.
